  <h1>Our developments</h1>
  <p>We are always looking to better our hosting and support. Currently we have a fully functional and secure core system. There are always improvements to be made, and we would love to hear from you if you would like a new feature. The following is a list of ideas. If you think any of these should be implemented, please consider using the feedback link on the left of the screen to suggest it.
  <ul>
    <li>Write a page on the security we use, and possible attacks made impossible.
    <li>Add autoclose option for /add/, so the add windows can automatically close after 5 seconds if they are registered with the DM bookmarklet.
    <li>Add support for URI prefix searches.
    <li>Add support for mime-type searches.
  </ul>
  <strong>Completed</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>30th of November, 2009: Basic statistics gathering has started and is shown on the front-page.

  <h2>Helping to mirror a file</h2>
    <p>To help mirror a file, you would have to download the file and publish it's metadata. Here is a small script to do that:
    <pre>
      #!/bin/bash
      echo UNTESTED
      exit 1
      mirrorpath='http://example.com/mirrordir'
      url=$1
      bs=`basename "$url"`
      #Download the file
      wget -O "$bs" "$url"
      #Create MD5 hash
      md5sum "$bs" &gt; "$bs"_md5.txt
      #Post Metadata
      wget {{ request.host_url }}/add/?url="$mirrorpath/$bs"_md5.txt
      #Done, you are now a registered mirror of that file
    </pre>  
  
</div>
